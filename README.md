# Path_finder

It's an academic project realized during the 2nd year of my master, within the practical work of industrial applications to data science.
this algorithm is programmed in python using the libraries : Matplotlib and Numpy 

It looks for the shortest path crossing vertically terrain, the more the area is in red the more time is needed to cross it.
